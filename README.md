# Metacognitive Judgments during Visuomotor Learning Reflect the Integration of Error History

`.csv` files are original data. `confidence_datastruct_remodel.m` transforms the `.csv` files into workable `.mat` dataframes, upon which we subsequently run the analyses (these would be dataConf_EXP1.mat and dataConf_EXP2.mat).

`.confidenceModeling_CLEAN.m` houses the model fitting code. Note the other `.mat` files in this repository are saved data frames from this code. Figures were generated using this code.

`func_conf_*.m` files are the model code.

Finally, we would like to thank the makers of the Matlab Violin Plot functions for facilitating the creation of Figure 4.
